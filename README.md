# Week 1 Project – Sustainable Energy & Climate Risk Management
## Project Overview

This project is part of Week 1 Assignment under the theme Climate Risk and Disaster Management.
The goal is to understand a sustainable energy dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prepare it for further insights.

By exploring the dataset, we identify key characteristics, missing values, and preliminary trends in renewable energy, which is crucial for building resilient and sustainable energy systems in the face of climate risks.

## Dataset
